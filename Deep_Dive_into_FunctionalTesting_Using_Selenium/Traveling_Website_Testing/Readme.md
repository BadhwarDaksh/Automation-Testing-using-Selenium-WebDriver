#Travel_Website_Testing

#Introduction and Prerequisite:

This Java code snippet demonstrates testing a travel website using Selenium WebDriver.Selenium WebDriver is a popular automation tool for web testing, and Java is the programming language used here. The code automates interactions with the website to test various features, including dropdown selection, dynamic dropdowns, and suggestive dropdowns. Before running this code, you need to have the following prerequisites in place:

Selenium WebDriver library for Java.

Chrome browser installed.

ChromeDriver executable.

#Given or Input:

The code starts by setting up the ChromeDriver and navigating to a specific URL (https://rahulshettyacademy.com/dropdownsPractise). It then performs various actions on the web page, such as selecting dropdown options, interacting with dynamic dropdowns, and entering text in a suggestive dropdown. Some of the actions include selecting currency, increasing the number of passengers, choosing origin and destination airports, and selecting options like Senior Citizen discount and trip type.

#Output:

The code includes assertions using TestNG's Assert class to validate certain conditions during the testing process. If the conditions are met, the assertions return true. The code outputs "done" to the console to indicate the successful completion of the test. If any assertion fails, it will throw an exception or provide appropriate error messages. Overall, the code tests the functionality of the travel website by automating user interactions and checking for expected behavior.
