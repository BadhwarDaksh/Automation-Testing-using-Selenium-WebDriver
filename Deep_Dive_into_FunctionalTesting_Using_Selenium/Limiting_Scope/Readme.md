#Introduction and Prerequisite:

The provided Java code demonstrates the usage of Selenium WebDriver to perform web automation tasks. It is essential to have Java and Selenium WebDriver set up in your development environment before running this code. The code specifically showcases the "Limiting Scope" concept, which is about focusing WebDriver actions within a specific area of a web page to perform various tasks.

#Given or Input:

The code starts by setting up the Selenium WebDriver with Chrome and navigating to the "http://qaclickacademy.com/practice.php" web page. It then performs the following tasks:

Counts the number of links on the page.
Finds the footer section with the ID "gf-BIG" and counts the number of links within it.
Limits the scope to the first column of the footer.
Clicks on each link in the first column to open them in new tabs.
Retrieves the titles of the opened tabs.

#Output:

The code provides the following outputs:
The count of links on the entire web page.
The count of links within the footer section.
The count of links in the first column of the footer.
The titles of the pages opened in new tabs, which corresponds to the links in the first column of the footer.
The code is an example of how to limit the scope of WebDriver actions to specific elements on a web page and interact with them using Selenium WebDriver with Java.
