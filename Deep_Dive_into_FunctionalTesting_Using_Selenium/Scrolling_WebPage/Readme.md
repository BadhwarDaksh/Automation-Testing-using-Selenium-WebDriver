**#Introduction and Prerequisites:**

This Java program demonstrates how to scroll a webpage using Selenium WebDriver, a popular tool for automating web browser interactions. The program uses the Chrome WebDriver to navigate to a specific webpage (https://rahulshettyacademy.com/AutomationPractice/). It then employs JavaScriptExecutor to scroll the webpage both vertically and horizontally. This scrolling is often useful for automating tasks like interacting with elements that are not initially visible on the screen. Prerequisites for running this code include Java installed on your system, Chrome WebDriver set up, and Selenium WebDriver Java bindings added to your project.

**# Given or Input:**

The given input for this program is the URL of the webpage to be tested, which is "https://rahulshettyacademy.com/AutomationPractice/". The program uses the Chrome WebDriver and JavaScriptExecutor for scrolling, and it targets a specific table on this webpage for demonstration purposes.

**# Output:**

The output of this program is the sum of values in a specific column of the table (the sum of values in the 4th column), which is then compared to the total amount displayed on the webpage. If the two values match, the program prints "done" to indicate successful execution. This output helps in verifying the correctness of the webpage's content and functionality.
