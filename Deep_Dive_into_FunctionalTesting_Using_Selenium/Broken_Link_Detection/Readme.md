#Broken Links Detection

#Introduction

This code can detect broken links in your website. A broken link is a hyperlink that points to a page or resource that does not exist. Most often, these linked pages were deleted or moved without a redirection set up. When the user or crawler follows a broken link, the server returns a 404 (Not found) or 410 (Gone) status code
