#Grocery Website Testing

1) Introduction and Prerequisite:
This Java program demonstrates automated testing of a grocery website using Selenium WebDriver. Selenium is a popular tool for web automation, and the test script is designed to interact with the website to simulate a user's actions. Prior to running this script, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

 i)   Java installed on your system.

 ii)  Selenium WebDriver for Java configured.

 iii) ChromeDriver installed and the path set correctly.

 iv)  The Chrome browser installed.

  v)  A compatible IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for Java, such as Eclipse 

2) Given or Input:
The input for this script is a list of grocery items to be added to the cart. In the provided code, the itemsNeeded array contains the names of items like "Cucumber," "Brocolli," and "Beetroot" that you want to add to your cart. The script will search for these items on the grocery website and add them to the cart if found.

3) Output:
The output of this script is the successful addition of the specified grocery items to the cart on the website. The script navigates to the grocery website, searches for the specified items, and adds them to the cart. The website's functionality is tested to ensure that the desired items can be added correctly. Any errors or issues encountered during this process will be reported as output in case of a failure, providing valuable feedback for testing and debugging.
