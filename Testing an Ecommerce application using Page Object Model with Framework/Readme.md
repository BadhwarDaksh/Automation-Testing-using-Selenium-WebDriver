**Introduction:**

This testing framework is designed for automated testing of an e-commerce application using the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. The POM design pattern is a way to organize your Selenium code, making it more readable, maintainable, and reusable. In this framework, each web page is represented as a Java class, and the elements and actions on that page are defined within that class.

**Prerequisites:**

Before running the tests using the provided framework, you need to ensure you have the following prerequisites:

Maven: You should have Maven installed on your system. The pom.xml file provided is a Maven project file that manages project dependencies and configurations.

Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have Java JDK installed on your system. The framework is written in Java.

TestNG: TestNG is used for test configuration and execution. Ensure you have TestNG properly installed and configured in your project.

Selenium WebDriver: Selenium WebDriver is essential for interacting with the web application. Make sure you have WebDriver installed and configured, typically for the Chrome browser in this case.

Test Data File (PurchaseOrder.json): This JSON file contains the necessary test data, such as login credentials and product names, used in the test scenarios. Make sure this file is accessible.

ExtentReports: ExtentReports is used for generating test reports. The provided pom.xml includes the dependency for ExtentReports, so it should be available.

Web Application: Ensure that the e-commerce web application you want to test is up and running.

pom.xml File: The provided pom.xml is the project configuration file that specifies dependencies and build settings. You need to have it available in your project.
Given (Input):

**The input for this framework  includes:**

Page Object Classes: The framework provides specific Page Object Classes representing different pages and components of the e-commerce application. These classes include:

LandingPagePractice: Represents the landing page of the e-commerce site.
CartPagePractice: Represents the shopping cart page.
CheckoutPagePractice: Represents the checkout page.
ConfirmationPagePractice: Represents the confirmation page.
ProductCataloguePagePractice: Represents the product catalog page.
Test Classes: Test classes contain the actual test scenarios for different aspects of the e-commerce application. These classes include:

PracticeStandAloneTest2: Contains test cases for different parts of the application.
PracticeErrorValidations: Contains test cases for error validation scenarios.
Test Data (PurchaseOrder.json): A JSON file containing data required for test scenarios. This includes email, password, and product names used during testing.

TestNG XML Configuration Files: The framework provides several TestNG XML configuration files that define test suites, groups, and which test classes should be executed during test runs.

**Output (on Running the Framework):**

When you run the provided framework code using TestNG XML files (Errorvalidations.xml, Purchase.xml) or as standalone test classes, here's what you can expect:

Test Execution: The tests defined in the TestNG XML files or in standalone test classes will be executed according to the configurations specified in the XML files.

Console Output: During test execution, you will see console output with information about the test progress. This includes the names of executed test cases and their results (pass or fail). Any test failures will be clearly indicated in the console.

ExtentReports Test Reports: After test execution, ExtentReports will generate detailed HTML test reports. These reports include information about test case names, descriptions, pass/fail status, and any captured screenshots in case of test failures. You can view these reports in a web browser to review the test results.

Exact Output on Running Errorvalidations.xml or Purchase.xml:

The exact output depends on the success or failure of the test cases. Here's what you can expect:

Passing Test Cases: If all test cases in the specified XML file pass, you will see a summary of the tests executed in the console, indicating that all tests passed. The ExtentReports generated will also display a summary with all test cases marked as "PASS."

Failing Test Cases: If any of the test cases fail, you will see detailed information about the failed test cases in the console. The failed test cases will be marked as "FAIL" in the ExtentReports. You can view the error messages, stack traces, and captured screenshots in the ExtentReports for each failed test.
